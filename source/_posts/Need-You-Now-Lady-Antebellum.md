> Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor

> Reaching for the phone cause I can t fight it anymore

> And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

> For me it happens all the time

> It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now

> Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now

> And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

> Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door

> Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

> And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

> For me it happens all the time

> It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now

> Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now

> And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

> Ooh…

> Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

> It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now

> And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

> And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

> I just need you now

> Oh baby I need you now


应该是最爱的一首歌了，昨天第一次在 KTV 唱它，发现自己唱的好难听。。。妈蛋，跪了。男声部分还可以，女声部分那个别扭啊。。。

瞬间觉得，如果哪天遇到个妹子唱这歌唱的好听，那我一定会忍不住去追她，哈哈。。。当然，肯定是她单身我也单身的情况下😂
